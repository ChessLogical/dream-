insane small codebase ib-- this is the rust ib i always dreamed of. I got pagination working, replies working its awesome. im trying to get it working for mp4 mp3 gif jpg bmp  webp webm to turn it into a chess site, the very last thing to do is get file uploads working. I think chatgpt is not helping me on purpose, prolly some blue haired kid told chatgpt all ib's are bad and to not help ppl. Anyone who can help with this and get file uploads working it would be awesome... a simple 300 line working ib made in rust- a dream ib. 

to install - compile and run on 8080 that is all!! it makes the db for you. Bam. (SLED db is also auto made and super nice to use by the way) also if you want to see a working version see my bbs repo i uploaded. https://github.com/ChessLogical/bbs BBS was the start of this app just the text functions reply and pagination and that app works awesome.
