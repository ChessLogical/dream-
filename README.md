latest update- got images working, rocket occasionally rejects an image claiming it is too large even when it is not, will try to solve. Will put some other necessary features on here and keep the codebase small. 


insane small codebase ib-- this is the rust ib i always dreamed of. I got pagination working, replies working its awesome. im trying to get it working for mp4 mp3 gif jpg bmp  webp webm to turn it into a chess site, the very last thing to do is get file uploads working better, slight bugs rn.

to install - compile and run on 8080 that is all!! it makes the db for you. Bam. (SLED db is also auto made and super nice to use by the way) also if you want to see a working version see my bbs repo i uploaded. https://github.com/ChessLogical/bbs BBS was the start of this app just the text functions reply and pagination and that app works awesome.
