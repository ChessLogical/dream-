insane small codebase ib-- this is the rust ib i always dreamed of. I got pagination working, replies working its awesome. im trying to get it working for mp4 mp3 gif jpg bmp  webp webm to turn it into a chess site, the very last thing to do is get file uploads working. I think chatgpt is not helping me on purpose, prolly some blue haired kid told chatgpt all ib's are bad and to not help ppl. Anyone who can help with this and get file uploads working it would be awesome... a simple 300 line workin ib made in rust.
